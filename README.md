# SpicyAPI
This API will be responsible for handling requests from the Spicy Glass mobile
app as well as the Raspberry Pi that is representing a car for our project and 
allow those uncoupled entities to make changes to our Firebase database storing
all car and user related information. The user will have the power to retrieve 
as well as change data using this API. 

## Getting Started

The following instructions will cover how to download and run a local 
deployment of the SpicyAPI with minimal dependencies.

### Prerequisites

You will need to first download the SpicyAPI repository from GitHub. To do so, 
type the following command in the terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/aj132608/SpicyAPI.git
```

The API runs on Python 3.7. So, if you don't have it, download a version 
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

We made installing dependencies for the development environment simple and 
easy. Here are the dependencies for SpicyAPI local.

* Flask
* requests

Just install the packages on our requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The API is run using Flask and is hosted on your local port 8080. Make sure 
that port is clear when running the program.

To run the API, type the following command:

```
python spicy_api.py
```

If everything runs properly, you should see this in your terminal.

```
 * Serving Flask app "spicy_api" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 271-809-182
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

```

Once the API is up on running, like shown above, you can start making requests
to the different routes that are available

### Routes
* get_full_database
* get_vehicle_id
* get_vehicle_data
* set_val

**Get Full Database**

Request Type: GET

Expected Input: NONE

Output: Dictionary with the contents of the whole Database

```

          "front": false
        }, 
        "seatHeater": {
          "bDriver": false, 
          "bPass": false, 
          "fDriver": false, 
          "fPass": false
        }
      }
    },

      }, 
      "states": {
        "carLock": true, 
        "carOn": true, 
        "defrost": {
          "back": false, 
          "front": false
        }, 
        "seatHeater": {
          "bDriver": false, 
          "bPass": false,

          "fPass": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

On your Flask terminal where you ran the API, something like this should appear:

```
{
    "V1": "V-1",
    "V2": "V-2"
